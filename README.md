# Electron-React-Boilerplate
Electron app with React.js

![](./docs/screenshot.png)
# How to develop
1. `npm i`
2. `npm start`
3. open application in build directory
4. add some react components and styles
5. reload application (âŒ˜+R)

# Electron api calling
To call Electron's api, it is necessary to use window.require because, browserify rewrites require statement.

ex) `var remote = window.require( 'remote' );`

## Refactoring

Run `npm run refactor` to refactor the code in accordance to [jscs preset](http://jscs.info/overview#presets) specified in the `.jscsrc` file.

## Linting

Run `npm run lint` to run a linter through the codebase. The linter will check
the codebase as specified in the [configuration file named `.eslintrc`](http://eslint.org/docs/user-guide/configuring). Fix all reported
errors prior to committing code.

An example of a `.eslintrc` follows:

```json
{
  "ecmaFeatures": {
    "modules": true,
    "blockBindings": true,
    "jsx": true,
    "templateStrings": true,
    "arrowFunctions": true
  },
  "rules": {
    "semi": 2
  }
}
```

## Testing (E2E)

In order to facilitate testing the instructions as specified in the 
[documentation](https://github.com/atom/electron/blob/master/docs/tutorial/using-selenium-and-webdriver.md)
are used. ChromeDriver is started and WebdriverIO connects to ChromeDriver
before testcases are run.

 - Run tests by running `npm run test`

In case on needs to use `this` inside the tests remember that the fat arrow
functions handle the housekeeping on [`this` variables somewhat differently](http://willi.am/blog/2015/07/21/mocha-error-this-dot-timeout-is-undefined/).
If `this` needs to be accessible use the `function() {}` instead of `() => {}`
